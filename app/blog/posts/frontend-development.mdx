Hi, I am Alisa, newbie to the world of software development. I enrolled as a student at The Hacking School just four weeks ago. Within this short span, I’ve delved into subjects like linux, javascript, node js, git ,GitHub and many more. I love the idea of creating something new, something exciting but sometimes it does feel overwhelming to learn so many new topics . However, developing frontend feels like renovating and decorating new house. Hence, I’m eager to offer insights into my comprehension of frontend development.

Frontend development is the practise of creating user interface and user experience of a website or web application.

A web page, collection of views, which add interactivity, a nice graphical user interface which will let me interact with some system, do operations or actions such as creating, reading, updating or deleting (CRUD) .For instance, consider a simple Todo list frontend where I can :

- (C)create a new todo list item
- (R)read existing todo list item’s
- (U)update an exisiting todo list item
- (D)delete an existing todo list item

A frontend with different views within a browser will allow me to carry out such tasks.

## The key components of Frontend Development:

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language): It provides the structure and content of web pages using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): It controls the presentation and styling of web pages, defining how HTML elements should be displayed, including layout, colors, fonts, and more.

- JavaScript: It is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages, allowing you to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), handle events, and create dynamic content

## Crafting the Frontend:

We can use the below popular tools and frameworks to streamline the development process and build an interactive and scalable web application.

- Frameworks : Libraries and framework like React, Angular and Vue.js are commonly used to build and dynamic user interfaces more efficiently.

- Preprocessors : SAAS and LESS are popular preprocessor scripting language that extend CSS with dynamic capabilities, making it easier and more efficient to write and manage stylesheet for web development.

- Build Tools: Tools like Webpack, Gulp and Grunt to automate tasks and improve the overall performance of frontend projects.

## Why Frontend ?

As they say, first impression count.A beautiful frontend seamlessly combines eye-catching elements with intuitive user interface, turns visitor into loyal user.

Here are some fun facts why frontend development can be more exciting.

- Immediate Visual Feedback: The results can be seen almost instantly.Every line of code can potentially alter the appearance and functionality of the user interface, providing immediate gratification.

- Creative Expression: Frontend development offers various opportunity for creativity. Developers can experiment with layouts, colours, animation to bring the designs to life.

- User-Centric Focus: Frontend development is inherently focused on the end user. Developers must consider usability, accessibility and responsiveness to ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience fir users across different devices and platforms.

- Technical Developments: The front-end development landscape is constantly evolving with new tools, frameworks and libraries emerging regularly. This fast-paced environment encourage developers to constantly learn and adapt to stay ahead of the curve.

## Conclusion

Frontend development offers a dynamic and rewarding experience for developers, driven by unique blend of creativity, direct impact on user experience and rapid technologies advancements.On the other hand, backend development a plays a crucial role in powering the functionality and performance of web application.

In just four weeks, I’ve dipped my toes into the vast world of software development. As I look ahead to completing my boot camp and venturing into the real world of software development, I know I will gain deeper understanding of both frontend and backend development.I extend my heartfelt gratitude to The Hacking School, and in particular to our mentor “Shabbir Jodhpurwala”, for patiently guiding us and helping us grow our skills. I am excited for the journey ahead and confident that the foundation I have built here will serve as well as I continue to learn and develop in this exciting field.
